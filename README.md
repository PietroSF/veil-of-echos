# World Overview
The Veil of Echos was once one of the domains where magic was a pervasive force, shaping the land and its inhabitants, at least until it was struck by a cataclysmic event known as the The Eclipse, bringing forth the age of The Great Silence and draining much of the magic from the world and leaving it in a state of slow decay.

### The Eclipse

The Eclipse is both a physical and metaphysical event. Physically, it is a celestial event where the sun is blocked out for a period of time, plunging the world into darkness. Metaphysically, it symbolizes the decline and fall of civilizations, the rise of chaos, and the reshuffling of power structures. The Moon and The Sun each represent cosmic orders, though opposite ones. Their meeting is an ill omen.

### Great Silence

The Great Silence is the pivotal event in the written history of the Veil of Echos. A council of powerful beings, known as the Dawn Spirits, had harnessed the magic of the Veil to create a golden age of prosperity. Due to a mysterious betrayal within the council, the harmony was broken, and their magic, the Echoing Veil, was dispelled. The world was plunged into an era known as the Great Silence, where magic became scarce and the once vibrant world began to decay.

### Echoing Veil

The Echoing Veil was part spell part artifact, an investiture of magic of immense power into material form capable of amplifying the magical energies within the Veil of Echos. The Dawn Spirits used the Veil to shape the world and its creatures. When it was dispelled, pieces of the Veil were scattered across the world, becoming coveted objects of myth and legend.

## The Races

### The Remnants

The Remnants are the descendants of the Dawn Spirits, now reduced to mortal beings. They possess innate but weakened magical abilities, often tied to a specific element or concept (like time, space, or nature). The Remnants are naturally drawn to the shards of the Echoing Veil, though they don't fully understand why.

### The Echos

The Echos are spectral beings that seem to be born from the residual magic in the world. They are often seen around the shards of the Echoing Veil and are believed to be echoes of the past when magic was more prevalent. They are mostly intangible and cannot interact with the physical world but can communicate through visions and dreams.

### The Touched

The Touched are the creatures of the world that were most affected by The Eclipse, struck by shards of the Echoing Veil. They were once normal animals and plants, but the event changed them, giving them strange appearances and abilities. Some have grown to massive sizes, others have developed an eerie intelligence, and some can even manipulate the limited magic left in the world.

### The Unchanged

The Unchanged are those creatures that were not affected by The Eclipse. They are now the most common creatures in the world, but they are often wary of magic and anything related to the time before the Great Silence.

### **Eclipse Wanderers**

Individuals known as the Eclipse Wanderers rise during each cycle of The Eclipse. They are marked by a strange power and are often thrust into the role of heroes or villains, their actions shaping the course of the world during the Eclipse.

# The Cosmography
### The Lands Between

The Veil of Echos is a world of polarity. In the western hemisphere the order of the Sun prevails, and in the eastern hemisphere the order of the Moon prevails. Though both hemispheres have day and night cycles, each is completely alien to the other, and contact between both is a feat of legend, as they are separated by The Lands Between, a chaotic rim circumscribing the Veil of Echos from North to South where the orders of The Sun and The Moon clash.

## Outer Earth

The world is a vast, decaying landscape filled with remnants of the golden age. Giant structures and sculptures litter the land, slowly crumbling away. The world is divided into regions, each with its unique character:

### The Hollow Forests

The Hollow Forest is a massive, evergreen forest. The trees of the Hollow Forest are immortal, enormous structures, remnants of a time when magic was prevalent. Their roots dig deep into the earth and to abyssal realms. The forest is filled with strange creatures, and shards of the Echoing Veil are often found here, embedded in the massive tree trunks.

### The Silent Deserts

The Silent Deserts were once vibrant oases filled with magic. Now, they are barren, with the sand itself seeming to absorb sound, creating an eerie silence. Occasionally, a sandstorm will reveal a buried piece of the Echoing Veil, but only to bury another.

### The Echoing Mountains

The Echoing Mountains are a range of towering peaks said to be where the Echoing Veil was shattered. The mountains are filled with caves and tunnels, and the rocks themselves are known to hum with a faint, almost imperceptible vibration, as if they still resonate with the ancient magic that once tore the Veil apart. At certain times, particularly when the Eclipse is nearing, the hum intensifies into a beautiful, mournful melody that can be heard throughout the valleys. The Echoing Mountains are a place of mystery and danger, filled with remnants of the world's ancient past. They are a testament to the world's history, bearing the scars of the Great Disruption, and serving as a reminder of the power that once was.

### The Echo's End

At the very peak of the highest mountain in the range lies a place known as the Echo's End. It is said that this is the exact point where the Echoing Veil was shattered. It is a place of great power and is believed to be a gateway to realms beyond our understanding. However, it is nearly inaccessible due to the harsh conditions and perilous terrain.


## Inner Earth

Beyond the known landscapes lie the massive caves of The Hollow Beneath, supported by the roots of the trees from The Hollow Forests and the depths of The Great Deep where the hemispheres are held together by The Pillars of the Earth.

### The Hollow Beneath

Beneath the Hollow Forest, a massive cave network extends, formed by the ancient, immortal roots of the trees that dug deep into the mantle of the Earth. This underworld, known as Sheol, is vast enough to host whole civilizations within it. This is where the Stonekin dwell, their societies built in the heart of the Earth, isolated from the Sun and Moon's influence. These sprawling subterranean landscapes are full of mystery and primordial power, and the deepest parts of Sheol are still uncharted.

### The Great Deep

As The Lands Between circumscribe the surface of the Earth, The Great Deep separates its hemispheres below the ground. It's an unexplored realm, home to the Abyssalkin. As Eclipsekin are to the peoples of the surface, so the Abyssalkin are to the Stonekin. Filled with high-pressure environments, luminescent creatures, and hidden forces, The Great Deep represents the chaotic energies of the depths, not where The Sun and The Moon meet, but rather where their influence is wholly absent. The Abyssalkin, shaped by the unique conditions of this abyssal environment, are enigmatic and rarely seen by the other races, to their fortune.

### The Pillars of the Earth

Binding the Eastern and Western hemispheres together are The Pillars of the Earth. These massive structures are said to connect the very foundations of the world, spanning across the whole of The Great Deep and providing a bridge between the hemispheres, holding them together.

# The Races

## Variants: Sunkin, Moonkin, Eclipsekin, Stonekin, and Abyssalkin

Each race - The Remnants, The Echos, The Touched, and The Unchanged - has various subsets dependent on the influences of the Sun, Moon, Eclipse, and the Inner Earth:

### Sunkin and Moonkin

Sunkin and Moonkin are found in the Western and Eastern hemispheres respectively, the Sunkin influenced by the energies of the Sun's order - vigor and dynamism - and the Moonkin by the energies of the Moon's order - contemplation and stillness. Each variant has adapted over time to embody the characteristics and traits of their respective hemispheres.

### Eclipsekin

These variants exist within The Lands Between. They are chaotic by nature, shaped by the clashing energies of the Sun and the Moon. The Eclipsekin are a testament to the volatile power of the Eclipse, and their nature, appearance, and abilities are the aberrant result of the interplay of the Sunkin and Moonkin traits.

### Stonekin

Within the continental caverns created by the roots of the Hollow Forest's trees, the Stonekin exist, unaffected by the influence of the Sun or the Moon. Isolated deep in the Earth, these beings have adapted to the darkness, evolving unique traits and abilities that allow them to navigate and survive in the underworld.

### Abyssalkin

In the depths of The Great Deep, the Abyssalkin dwell. Unlike the Eclipsekin of The Lands Between their aberrant nature is not a result of the clash of opposing orders, but the result of the total absence of order altogether. They represent a chaotic and rarely-seen variant of the races, affected by the abyssal pressures and the hidden, enigmatic forces of the deep.
